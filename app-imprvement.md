check Atomic_Habits_App_Design.md for more clarity about certain features, functionalities and use cases that we haven't included like the Temptation Bundle Creator      
  where you pair a habit you NEED to do with an activity you WANT to do.. obviously try to guide smoothly the user to support them in knowing the activity they WANT TO DO  
  and suggest it to be paired maybe if you have existing templates that can help as guide or examples that they can use as references to know what they want\
  Make it easy (don't give the user that much power to decide HOW they WANT to make it easy.. you plan based on the 2 minute rule.. give examples for each habit scale      
  down any habit to a version that takes less that two minutes to start)\
  add a VISUAL STREAK COUNTER.. Celebratory animations and progress trackers make showing up its own reward\
  \
  now let's go to breaking a bad habit: \
  they obviously shouldn't be in the same page as the habits we want to build.. we can't have smoking in the same page as exercice (separate the habits we want to build    
  with the habits we want to break).. \
  now rule 1 as a feature: Cue Elimination Checklist: an audit tool to help identify and remove environmental triggers for the bad habit\
  Rule 2: to make it unattractive: Cost visibility journal: reframe your mindset by tracking the negative consequences of the habit (time, money, health, focus, energy,    
  family, kids, hormones, discipline....)\
  3. to make it difficult: Friction Tracker: Add barriers between the user and the bad habit, such as using app blockers, or commitment devices or simple setting up the    
  environment in a way to make it hard to do that habit for example doom scrolling (delete the apps, delete the account, etc.. )\
  4. the last one is to make it unsatisfying: make slip-ups immediately painful by automatically notifying a designated partner for example.. or having to pay money to     
  someone  or having to do a chore (depends on the timing, situation and so on )



add a bar in the bottom of the app with (home, done, notification or reminders, settings (in the bottom))
the top bar includes (account (profile picture when you click it it takes you to your account) on the far left, on the far right the reminders (notifications))

the first home page a message like Good Morning [User Name] if it's morning and Good Evening if it's evening 

a small message saying (Welcome to your habits and overall progress for your week)
Today's Focus (with 3 dots on the far right to click on it to modify the list of today)
in today's scroll list you have to-dos with the streak showing 
for example {
-Meditate for 2 mins
Sat: not done, Sun: done, Mon: done, Tue: not done....

-Read one page
}
if you click on the task it shows the streak and it gives a success sound effect and celebratory effects


instead of creating habits the way we do currently.. it's best to create "INTENTIONS" example: {I will
<input type:"text">Meditate for 2 mins </input>

at: (time and days of week) for example (8am every Sunday)

in: (location) in my living room
}

Stack your habit:
{ (container showing the current habit): 
After my current habit: 
<input> Morning Coffee</input>

(second container showing the new intention):
.get intention we just created

<button>Create Stack</button>

send notification : (
(the app's name)
Welcom home! The Law of Least Effort says now is the best time to change into your workout clothes.)
}


add community challenges for example:
{
30-Day Writing Challenge 
habit Circle  (your community)
profile picture of Anna   -- Anna: 22/3- days
progress bar (showing the %) without the "%"

profile picture of Brahim   -- Brahim: 22/3- days
progress bar (showing the %) without the "%"

comments below that almost as a forum where people congratulate the action takers, or share their progress, share some tricks or whatever..
}

Create a Bundle as we discussed earlier: 
{Pair the habit I need to do: 
<input>Process work emails for 15 min</input>

With the habit I WANT to do: 
<input>Listten to my favorite podcast</input>

see if it's possible to include a button like on off type saying "Only allow podcast playback when email habit is active" (but it obviously changes depending on the habit I WANT to do)
}
in each habit when created set Goal and what to start with example: 
{
Goal:
<input>Read before Bed</input>

Start with:
<input>Read one page</input>
}
because a habit must be established before it can be improved

for habits we want to Break, add a page "PAUSE." that forces the screen to lock on that page for 60s saying: {Pause
"You committed to reducing screen time. is opening this app helping you become the person you want to be?"

loading animation (in % without "%") to show the seconds left and second done ratio from the 60s

"This screen will disapear in 60 seconds."
}
in the Habit Tracker
use the clip-jar images (jar empty with 3 to 4 paper clips inside) (To Do) and another jar with a lot of paper clips (Done) 
obviously it starts in the opposite way (when you just start you fill the "Done" jar with paperclips every time you do the task in other words you take a paper clip from the To-Do jar and put it in the "Done" jar) once done jar is full you're rewarded
and to be punished every day you don't do a task you take 2 paper clips from the done and put them in the To-Do again

add an identity page:  where every action the user takes is a vote for the type of person they wish to become

{
Your identity
I am a writer                                    ✅
Vote Cast today: Wrote 500 words.


I'm an Athlete                                  ✅
Vote Cast today: Completed my workout


I'm a developper                                  ✅
Vote Cast today: Practiced Javascript
}

The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. Atom helps you focus on becoming, not just doing. We don't just build habits; we build identities.

The last 2 parts are an email to the Accountability partner
{
To: Sarah (Accountability Partner)
Subject: My Weekly Progress from Atom (Atom is the app's name later)

screenshot of 
Habit completion (chart showing the % of completion)
another container showing the daily progress in bar chart for each day
Another container: Longest Streak: 28 Days (Meditation)
}


and the final thing to add is Weekly reflection for the user:
👍 What wen well this week?
<input></input>

👎 What didn't go well?
<input></input>

🎓 What did I learn?
<input></input>


btw the theme is preferably if light mode (white and gradient blue)  the blue of the light zone is #2d669b    and the blue of the dark zone is  #173451 with white background but toooo white and almost black font 


and if dark mode the background is gradient in the same way I told you earlier and the font is white 

don't forget the Back (⬅️) button on the top left please always except for the home page where we have the account picture there
